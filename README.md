# 🔐RSA Encryption (C++)
A C++ program that **encrypts and decrypts messages using the RSA algorithm**, supporting long text messages and a wide range of symbols. The project demonstrates **public-key cryptography**, including message signing and key generation

## 🚀 Features
* Encrypts messages using RSA public and private keys.
* Decrypts messages to verify integrity.
* Generates a simple digital signature for each message.
* Handles long messages and symbols efficiently using modular exponentiation.
